# Purpose
this repogitory is run to study reinforcement learning.
thus, we apply the tech to control Self-discipline system.

# contents
1. basic: that is the code to check fundamental reinforcement theology.
2. documents: that is the note of reinforcement-learning.
3. pole-problem: that is the code to try the feinforcement learning.
